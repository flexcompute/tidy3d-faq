<div><div>Tidy3D is Flexcompute's ultrafast electromagnetic (EM) solver. The solver is based on the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method. Thanks to the highly optimized co-design of software and hardware, Tidy3D runs simulations orders of magnitude faster than other EM solvers on the market. With the lightning fast speed, you can also solve problems hundreds of wavelength in size, which is often not feasible with conventional approaches.</div></div>
