<div><div>Tidy3D simulations can be defined in two ways: our web <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tidy3d.simulation.cloud">GUI</a> or Python scripts. If you do not have Python programming experience, you can use our feature-rich web GUI to define simulation, submit simulation, and visualize simulation results.</div><div>Â </div><div>Since defining simulation and performing post-processing in Python offers additional flexibity, we do recomment our users to learn to use Python, especially for more complex simulations. There are a lot of great free resources for learning Python online. You can also reference our <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://docs.flexcompute.com/projects/tidy3d/en/latest/index.html">Python API documentation</a> as well as a variety of</div><div>examples in our <a href="https://www.flexcompute.com/tidy3d/learning-center/">Learning Center</a>.</div></div>
