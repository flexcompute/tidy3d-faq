If you need help with a Tidy3D object, you can run the command: `help(<class name>)`&nbsp;or&nbsp;`<class name>.help()` where `<class name>`&nbsp;is the name of the object class (e.g., `Box`). You can also refer to the [Tidy3D Python documentation](https://docs.flexcompute.com/projects/tidy3d/en/latest/index.html) to find information on objects and their usage. Additionally, you can search for more details on object usage in the [Learning Center](https://www.flexcompute.com/tidy3d/learning-center/).
