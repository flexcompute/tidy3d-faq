Tidy3D comes with a feature-rich graphical user interface ([GUI](https://tidy3d.simulation.cloud/folders){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}) that offers many tools to create and run electromagnetic simulations with ease and intuitiveness. With [Tidy3D GUI](https://www.flexcompute.com/tidy3d/learning-center/tidy3d-gui/), you can quickly analyze simulation results, conduct parameter sweeps, perform mode analysis, access simulation information, and manage your account. Additionally, a complete Python notebook development environment is included, allowing you to utilize the flexibility of [Tidy3D Python](https://www.flexcompute.com/tidy3d/learning-center/tidy3d-python/) without installing the client interface.
