Very often we want to calculate the overlap integral of two modes to compute the coupling efficiency. This can be done conveniently using the outer\_dot method such as&nbsp;

<div markdown class="code-snippet">{% highlight python %}

overlap = waveguide_mode_data_1.outer_dot(waveguide_mode_data_2)

{% endhighlight %}
{% include copy-button.html %}
</div>

where <code markdown class="language-plaintext">waveguide_mode_data_1</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code markdown class="language-plaintext">waveguide_mode_data_2</code>&nbsp;are ModeSolverData objects from performing the mode solving.&nbsp;

For advanced monitor data manipulation such as integration, please refer to the [tutorial](https://www.flexcompute.com/tidy3d/examples/notebooks/XarrayTutorial/).
