Yes, if you want to try Tidy3D, you don't need to have Python installed. First, you'll need to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[sign up](https://tidy3d.simulation.cloud/signup)&nbsp;for a free user account.&nbsp;Then you can try both, the feature-rich&nbsp;[Tidy3D GUI](https://tidy3d.simulation.cloud){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}&nbsp;interface and a pre-installed&nbsp;[Tidy3D Python notebook](https://tidy3d.simulation.cloud/notebook){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"} development environment.
