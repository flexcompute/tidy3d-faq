Yes. Suppose you are new to Tidy3D and would like to experience ultrafast electromagnetic simulations. In that case, you can apply for a free trial, which allows you to test many small to medium-sized simulations. The free trial aims to familiarize you with Tidy3D and evaluate its capabilities for your project. During the trial period, we provide full technical support to answer any questions you might have about using Tidy3D.
