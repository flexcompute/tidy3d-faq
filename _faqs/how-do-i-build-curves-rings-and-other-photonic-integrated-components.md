The&nbsp;[gdstk](https://heitzmann.github.io/gdstk/)&nbsp;library offers a convenient and flexible way to construct commonly used photonic integrated circuit (PIC) components, such as straight waveguides, linear tapers, rings, race tracks, s-bends, circular bends, and directional couplers. This [notebook](https://www.flexcompute.com/tidy3d/examples/notebooks/PICComponents/) contains pre-defined functions used to construct commonly used PIC components. Users can directly copy these pre-defined functions to their script and use them to build their simulations. More importantly, users can learn the workflow from these examples and create their own Tidy3D structures using the same principles.
