The [gdstk](https://heitzmann.github.io/gdstk/) library offers a convenient and flexible way to construct commonly used photonic integrated circuit (PIC) components, such as straight waveguides, linear tapers, rings, race tracks, s-bends, circular bends, and directional couplers. This [notebook](https://www.flexcompute.com/tidy3d/examples/notebooks/PICComponents/) contains pre-defined functions used to construct commonly used PIC components. Users can directly copy these pre-defined functions to their own script and use them directly in building their simulations. More importantly, users can learn the workflow from these examples and build their own Tidy3D structures using the same principles.
