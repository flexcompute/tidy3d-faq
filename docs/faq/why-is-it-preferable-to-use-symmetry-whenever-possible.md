In many Tidy3D simulations, the application of field symmetries can markedly decrease computational time and FlexCredit cost, potentially achieving reductions by factors of 1/2, 1/4, or even 1/8. Therefore, we prefer to use symmetry whenever applicable. In addition, symmetry effectively filters out unwanted light polarizations or modes.

However, correctly setting up the symmetry is essential to avoid getting incorrect results. For a more extensive discussion on symmetry, please visit the dedicated [tutorial](https://www.flexcompute.com/tidy3d/examples/notebooks/Symmetry/).
