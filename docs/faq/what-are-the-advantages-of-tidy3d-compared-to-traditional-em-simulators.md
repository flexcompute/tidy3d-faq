There are several unique advantages that set Tidy3D apart from other tradition EM simulators. First of all, Tidy3D provides cloud-based simulation services. Our users do not need to purchase nor manage their own dedicated computer hardware, which is a great time and cost saving. Secondly, Tidy3D utilizes a proprietary co-design of software and hardware. The end result is lightning-fast simulation speed and scalability. Compared to traditional CPU-based EM simulators, Tidy3D is orders of magnitude faster, which enables a short R&amp;D design cycle. Lastly, Tidy3D not only has a feature-rich web GUI, but also fully embraces the flexible Python environment. Our users can construct simulations either using the GUI or Python scripts.
