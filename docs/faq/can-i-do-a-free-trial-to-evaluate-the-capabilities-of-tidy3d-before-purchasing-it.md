Yes. If you are new to Tidy3D and would like to experience the ultrafast electromagnetic simulations, you can apply for a free trial which allows you to test a good number of small to medium sized simulations. The goal of the free trial is to get you familiarized with Tidy3D and evaluate its capabilities on your project. During the trial period, we provide full technical support to answer any questions you might have about using Tidy3D.
