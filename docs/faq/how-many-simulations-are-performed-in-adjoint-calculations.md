Two simulations, the <code>forward</code> and the <code>adjoint</code> one, are performed when running inverse design optimizations using the <code>adjoint</code> plugin. 

 

We highly recommend watching the <a href="https://www.flexcompute.com/tidy3d/learning-center/inverse-design/">Inverse Design</a> lectures if you are new to the adjoint method. You can also go through this <a href="https://www.flexcompute.com/tidy3d/examples/notebooks/AdjointPlugin1Intro/">tutorial</a> for an introduction to the basic concepts related to automatic differentiation and adjoint optimization.
