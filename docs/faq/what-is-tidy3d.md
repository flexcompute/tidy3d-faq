Tidy3D is Flexcompute's ultrafast electromagnetic (EM) solver. The solver is based on the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method. Thanks to the highly optimized co-design of software and hardware, Tidy3D runs simulations orders of magnitude faster than other EM solvers on the market. With lightning-fast speed, you can also solve problems with hundreds of wavelengths in size, which is often not feasible with conventional approaches.
