At the moment Tidy3D does not support continuous and discrete rotational symmetries. Only mirror symmetries are supported. For more information on how to use symmetry to significantly reduce simulation time and cost, please refer to [Defining and using symmetries](https://www.flexcompute.com/tidy3d/examples/notebooks/Symmetry/) tutorial.
