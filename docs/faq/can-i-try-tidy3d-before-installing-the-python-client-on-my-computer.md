Yes, if you want to try Tidy3D, you don't need to have Python installed. First, you'll need to   [sign up](https://tidy3d.simulation.cloud/signup) for a free user account. Then you can try both, the feature-rich [Tidy3D GUI](https://tidy3d.simulation.cloud) interface and a pre-installed [Tidy3D Python notebook](https://tidy3d.simulation.cloud/notebook) development environment.
